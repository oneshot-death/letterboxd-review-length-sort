didn’t know a ton about this going into it, especially the similarities to paterson. watching a guy read books, listen to music, and work on toilets shouldn’t be this riveting, but it is. and that’s the kind of stuff i can’t get enough of because when you get it right, it’s so easy to get lost in the work. love the commitment to the dream montage, one of the better depictions of dreaming i’ve seen and they never forget to throw… more

Having trouble staying focused lately. Staying alert, staying grateful, staying content. Just staying still and looking around. It's always an issue but the world more and more feels like it's surely impossible for anyone, not just me. It's a low-grade—often not so low—anxiety, paranoia, gloom, just kind of throw it all in and shut the blinds kind of way. There's no room for small things, no time for plain tiny pleasures. They're romanticised because they just don't seem real. Even… more

A lot of the best cinema of 2023 was about suffering and humanity's capacity to inflict harm: The creation of atomic warfare, systemic murder of those closest to you, genocide, grappling with loss in our past, or of loved ones, abusive relationships, the alienation of modern life, even the one about the toy doll was really about accepting life in the face of death. Each of these movies address this suffering in different ways, some see it as almost inevitable and futile, some challenge us to examine ourselves, accept ourselves, some are trying to act as a startling wake-up call, others are just acknowledging the awkward, messy complexity of grief. What is it that lies beneath so much of this suffering? These days I'm suspicious that the common theme underneath all of these is our collective inability to be with the moment and the world as it really is. Our constant striving for greatness for ourselves. Our insatiable hunger for more. Our desire to construct indestructible identities. To "protect" ourselves, or our country at any cost. Our attempts to create perfection instead of finding it where it already exists. Hirayama finds beauty and perfection in his imperfect life. Simplicity, humility, solitude, contentment, and slowing down to appreciate the elegant beauty that life hides in all it's little corners and crevices. This is what we need. These are radical in the face of the headlong spiral towards self-annihilation we're caught up in, that most of last year's cinema so beautifully and hauntingly illustrated. This is the antidote. Also Tokyo has some beautiful toilets. Read a full review on my newsletter.

Wender's Paterson. definitely an answer to his buddy Jimmy. a minimalistic celebration of the little wonders of life. feel good cinema for the cultural bourgeoisie, Wim's fanbase.or is this Wender's Barbie? dude has the time of his life in the fantastic world of toilet beasts. then realizes that there's this thing called "reality" where you got family traumata, cancer and stuff like that. what a bummer.the romantic fetishization of the working class, right from the longing, wishful perspective of the belittling aristocracy. the toilet man reads Faulkner and listens to cassette tapes from the 80s of music from the 60s. in the naivety that is put on display in bright light the movie doesn't realize how cynic this could be read. pretty sure that all those buddhist philosophies - essentially the core of the whole thing as it seems - were put on paper and film much more discrete and humble in the asian culture itself before. Wenders just goes there and plunders long known facts of life for european arthouse audiences. still, there is a very mildness coming with the age visible here. Old Wimmy is going down the pledge of life, this might already be his farewell.
