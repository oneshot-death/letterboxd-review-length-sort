Read somewhere that this got remade in Hong Kong a couple years later and that remake was a big influence on John Woo for A Better Tomorrow (and thus an influence on pretty much all of Hong Kong cinema post-1986). The connection is obvious (two brothers, one a cop, one a crook), if not especially deep: the movies do entirely different things with the setup, with Deewaar more focused on the ruptures in the family (and their effect on the mother) than anything else, while Woo kills off the father pretty quickly. 

Both films emphasize the social conditions that lead to criminality, but Chopra ultimately presents it as a choice, a forced one for Bachchan's socialist father, an almost self-sacrificial one for Bachchan himself, while Woo spends most of his film boxing his heroes into their tragic fates. Woo the Christian also grants his anti-hero redemption through the martyrdom of Chow Yun-fat's character, his death allowing the two brothers to reunite. There's no best friend figure for Chopra, however, and the family is irrevocably split and haunted by the loss of its black sheep.

What if I told you Deewar directly gave birth to the action-melodrama scene in Hong Kong in the 80s and 90s that had the whole world in a chokehold? Yes, it is true in a way. Deewar's impact was felt throughout the world when the Legendary Shaw Brothers themselves decided to remake the film in 1979 that went on to inspire John Woo's whole style and led him to make A Better Tomorrow in 1979 that changed action cinema forever. That's how important of a film Deewar is. It's a kind of film only Asians can fall in love with. The melodrama is within us, man. Sure, Deewar steps into over melodrama quite a few times but it was 1975. It was the norm. But this is not any melodrama, this is Salim-Javed melodrama. Two writers who became so popular that they began to earn more money than the actors themselves. Just listen to the dialogue here. Yes, it is very cinematic and melodramatic but it still sounds so razor sharp. There is a scene where the son just learns that his father who abandoned them years ago passed on. The son is devastated and needs to convey this to his mother. So if Deewar came out today there would've been a dialogue where in the son would say the father passed on and the mom would cry and so on. But here, the son is unable to say it out. He goes near his mom. The mother is about to apply sindhoor on her head( which is an old, stupid culture where the woman has to apply sindhoor on the head everyday until the husband dies), but the son stops her and she immediately understands that the husband is dead and breaks down. That is how you write a scene without throwing in much exposition. There are similar brilliantly written and staged scenes throughout. 

The first action block with Amitabh Bachchan in the garage? How cool can a man get? These Bollywood actors these days are nothing but Amitabh wannabes. They don't have 0.1% of the charm and swag Amitabh had back in the day and still does(?). All these actors have is a rich dad but none of that style and swagger. Amitabh is great during the emotional beats, too. The scene at the temple is so well acted. Amitabh is easily the best part in a film where most of the actors are overracting - but hey, it was the 70s. I really the Anita character, who was played by Parveen Babi. She got a moment or two to shine and she did. 

The narrative is super solid and engaging despite the nearly 180 minute runtime. Some scenes did feel rushed. For instance, Vijay falling into the world of crime could've been fleshed out even better than what we got. But the face off scenes between the two brothers are an absolute blast. The cinematography is so striking. The 70s zoom man. Lmao. I fucking love it. There is a zoom in probably every shot. The wide shots? Absolutely beautiful. Bombay looked so good back then. All the vintage cars and Amitabh just walking by it. Beautiful visuals. To me, the sometimes extreme melodrama and unnecessary filler songs were the only downsides. It's a bummer that none of the songs even hit me like that. They were just there. 

But, Deewar is Bollywood gold. Classic commercial cinema. And one of the most influential films ever made.

Deewaar is a film which is truly epic and glorious in every way. This film's impact on Indian cinema as a whole has been nothing but immense. It won't be wrong to say that this invented the Masala cinema and influenced it so much that the tropes of this film can be visible in almost all the films of this genre and all of them try to imitate what this one did.… more
